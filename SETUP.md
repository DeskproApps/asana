Once you've logged in, click on your avatar at the top right of the screen and choose "My settings..."

Give the token a name - this can be anything, something like "Deskpro App" will do.

When you install the Asana app in Deskpro, enter this token into the settings tab of the app.

To configure who can see and use the Asana app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
